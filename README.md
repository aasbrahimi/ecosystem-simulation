# Ecosystem Simulation in C

# Project Overview
This project consists in implementing a simple virtual ecosystem simulation
using the C programming language.

The ecosystem is composed of prey and predators evolving on a discrete
two-dimensional toroidal world.

# Objectives
- Practice linked list manipulation
- Use dynamic memory allocation safely
- Apply modular programming in C
- Simulate interactions between prey and predators

# Technical Concepts
- Singly linked lists
- Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`)
- Assertions (`assert`)
- Modular compilation (`.c` / `.h`)
- Makefile usage
- Debugging with gdb and valgrind

# Technologies
- C language
- GCC
- Makefile
- Linux development environment

# Repository Structure
- `code/` : source code of the ecosystem simulation
- `statement/` : university project description

# Academic Context
