## Project Statement

This project is based on a university assignment for the course LU2IN018
(Bachelor in Computer Science – Sorbonne Université).

The goal is to implement a simple ecosystem simulation using:
- Linked lists
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Modular C programming

The ecosystem contains prey and predators evolving on a 2D toroidal grid.
